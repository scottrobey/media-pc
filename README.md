Contains documentation and setup files for my home media PC.

## Operating System - Windows (Linux coming later...)

### Windows Setup
Initial win setup - may want to not set a password when creating a user. Or better would be to create a new user with limited permissions that doesn't need password

## Brave

Brave is what we primarily use to access streaming and other sites due to it's superior ad blocking and ease-of-use. I don't actually know if we lose much in the form of picture or audio quality compared to using the native desktop apps, but something to look into

On desktop create a folder names "Streaming Sites"
Create shortcuts for all of the streaming sites - click and drag from the dots to the left of the website address to the desktop
Place Brave shortcuts for your streaming sites on your desktop in a folder named "Media Center" (or whatever you want).
Create good icons for the shorcuts, see: icons folder 


Using the steps listed above to "Add Programins to Launch at Startup" add a shortcut to this folder in the startup folder and the folder will be opened automatically when your Mini PC starts

Inside Brave:
 * F11 to go full screen
 * Use Brave Password manager?

Show bookmarks toolbar - ctrl+shift+b
Import bookmarks - can export from my env first. this repo has bookmarks included you can import
Create a bookmarks folder for streaming or other sites
